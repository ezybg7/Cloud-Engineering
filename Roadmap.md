## Fundamentals
#### [[Git]]
Version Control
#### [[Bash]]
For automating tasks (scripting)
#### [[Networking]]
Understand how data moves across the internet.
How networks function and how components communicate
#### [[Virtualization]]
Core of cloud computing
Multiple users share resources on one computer
#### [[Operating systems]]
Organizes, controls, and manages everything on computer
#### [[Databases]]
Stores, organizes, and fetches information

## Cloud Platform(s)
Start with the most popular one ([[AWS]]) and also focus on the most poplar AWS Services
Example AWS Services to focus on : S3, EC2, Route 53, IAM, RDS etc...
AWS Architecture are built on
#### [[AWS]] (Amazon) 
#### [[GCP]] (Google)
#### [[Azure]] (Microsoft)

## Certification
#### [[AWS Cloud Practitioner]]

## Cloud Console
Learn the cloud console first instead of just command lines, easier to understand status and health of services.

## Cloud Architecture
DOs and DON'Ts
Core pillars of architecture and solution design
High Availability, Scalability, Fault Tolerance, Disaster Recovery
How services are integrated together

## Coding in the cloud
[[Git]] and [[Bash]] first, then learn [[Python]] and [[TypeScript]]
#### [[Python]]
Let's use Python as our language of choice when doing LeetCode
#### [[TypeScript]]
Let's recreate my personal portfolio over winter break using [[TypeScript]] as an opportunity to learn it

## Cloud Tools
One tool for infrastructure code ([[Terraform]]), one tool for CRCD ([[GitHub Actions]]), and one tool for your cloud platform ([[AWS]] / [[Azure]] / [[GCP]])
#### [[Terraform]]
**Infrastructure Code**
: Defining the desired state of your infrastructure through text files, allowing for automated setup and configuration instead of manual processes, enabling faster deployment and consistent environments across different environments. 

Users can define infrastructure resources in human-readable configuration files that can be versioned, reused, and shared. 
#### [[GitHub Actions]]
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRCD) error detection technique in networking and data storage.
It generates a short code (checksum) that is appended to the original data at the sending end, and then recalculated at the receiving end to compare and identify any corruption during transmission.
#### [[AWS]] / [[Azure]] / [[GCP]]
Cloud Platform, we're starting with [[AWS]]

## Project
Create a project that combines Terraform, AWS, and Github Actions. Putting into practice what we learned and demonstrates a level of skill.
