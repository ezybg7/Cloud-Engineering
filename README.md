# Cloud-Engineering-Self-Study
 Everett's notes for cloud engineering and a roadmap for him to follow
 Included are everything I am currently reviewing to make sure I have my fundamentals down
 There are also new things I am learning
 The goal is to get my first cloud engineering certification by Summer of 2025
